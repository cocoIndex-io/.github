Data indexing is the process of transforming raw data into a format optimized for retrieval. It‚Äôs essential to back RAG and semantic search. 

CocoIndex is the world's first open-source engine that supports both custom transformation logic and incremental updates specialized for data indexing.

With CocoIndex, users declare the transformation, CocoIndex creates & maintains an index, and keeps the derived index up to date based on source update, with minimal computation and changes.
